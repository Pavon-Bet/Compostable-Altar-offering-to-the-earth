**Seasonal agricultural waste research:** 

_What is the contribution of each ingredient?_

_Avocado Leaves_
- Contain nitrogen, which is a key component for composting. Nitrogen helps stimulate the growth of microorganisms that break down the organic matter in the compost.
- Provide a good amount of organic matter, which is essential for creating a well-balanced compost.
- Contain minerals and vitamins that can enrich the compost, contributing to soil fertility once the compost is ready.

_Clementine and Lemon Peel (Citrus)_
- Rich in antimicrobial compounds: They contain essential oils (limonene, citronella, pinene) that can have antifungal and antibacterial effects on the soil.
- Contribution of organic matter: They decompose slowly, improving soil structure and promoting moisture retention.
- Stimulation of beneficial microorganisms: In small quantities, they can favor the growth of decomposing microorganisms.
- Natural pest repellent: Its essential oils can help reduce the presence of some insects and nematodes.

_Pomegranate peel_
- Rich in tannins and polyphenols: Antioxidant properties that can improve soil microbial activity and contribute to crop root health.
- Nutrient source: Contains potassium and small amounts of phosphorus and calcium, essential for fruit development.
- Stimulates soil biodiversity: Its slow decomposition favors the proliferation of beneficial fungi.

_Leaves and olive residues_
- Contribution of organic matter and carbon: Improves soil fertility in the long term.
- Bioactive compounds (oleuropein and polyphenols): Can influence soil microbiota and help in the suppression of pathogens.
- Promotes soil structure: Avoids compaction and improves aeration, promoting better root development.

_Kiwi peel_
- Promotes microbial activity in the soil, as it is rich in fiber and natural sugars that feed beneficial microorganisms.
- Its decomposition releases bioactive compounds that can stimulate soil life and improve soil fertility.
- Its high dietary fiber content (cellulose and pectin) helps maintain soil porosity, promoting aeration and moisture retention.
- Reduces the risk of compaction, allowing better root development in fruit crops.
- Contains potassium, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium, essential for the development of fruit trees.
- Provides small amounts of antioxidants and polyphenols, which can benefit soil microbiota and protect roots against oxidative stress.
- Contains potassium, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium, essential for the development of fruit trees.
- Provides small amounts of antioxidants and polyphenols, which can benefit the soil microbiota and protect roots against oxidative stress.

_Wood dust_
- Improves soil structure: wood fiber increases aeration and moisture retention.
- pH regulation: Wood can be acidic or neutral depending on the type.
Fruit peelings are usually acidic, so the combination could be balanced.
- Effect on decomposition: Wood is rich in lignin and cellulose, which decompose slowly.
*Fruits have more sugars and starches, which degrade quickly.
Mixing them could make decomposition more balanced and prolong
